Git development was started by Torvalds in April 2005
 when the proprietary source-control management
 (SCM) system used for Linux kernel development since 2002,
 BitKeeper, revoked its free license for Linux development.[21][22] 
The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, claimed that Andrew Tridgell
 had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.[23]
 The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.

Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper,
 but none of the available free systems met his needs. He cited an example
 of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch a
nd update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the
 needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers 
could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criterion, he specified that 
patching should take no more than three seconds, and added three more goals:[10]
